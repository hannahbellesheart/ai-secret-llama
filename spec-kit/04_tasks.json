# 03_TASKS — Per-iteration task list (generic)

This file contains the project's `3.x` tasks. Each task must be small, focused, and include verifiable acceptance criteria and verification commands.

Task format (example):

- id: 3.01
  title: Implement feature A
  description: Short description of the feature
  acceptanceCriteria:
    - Criterion 1 (testable)
    - Criterion 2 (testable)
  verificationCommands:
    - bash spec-kit-creation/06_verify.sh $BASE_URL
  status: not-started
  artifacts: []

Per-iteration checklist (to be followed for every task):
- Implement only the selected task (no unrelated edits).
- Run verification: `bash 06_verify.sh <BASE_URL>`.
- On success: set `status: completed`, attach artifact path(s), and append changelog entry to `04_changelog.md`.
- On critical failure: fix and re-run verification before marking completed.

Add tasks by duplicating the example block and incrementing `3.xx` ids.
